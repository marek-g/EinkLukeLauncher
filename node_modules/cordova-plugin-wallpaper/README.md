# cordova-plugin-wallpaper

This simple plugin gives you the ability of setting the systems wallpaper, either by using an image you brought with the application in its www-directory or by using a Base64-encoded string of an image. This lets you choose the image after the installation of the application and even change it afterwards, you just have to pass over a new Base64 encoded image.
